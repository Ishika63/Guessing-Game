## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- **Education:** To provide an educational resource for those learning Python, demonstrating essential concepts such as conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling.

- **Entertainment:** To create an enjoyable gaming experience that keeps players engaged and motivated to improve their guessing skills.

- **Customization:** To offer two distinct game modes, catering to different levels of difficulty and player preferences.


## Motivation

The Guessing-Game project was born out of a passion for both programming and gaming. It serves as an example of how programming can be used to create interactive and entertaining applications. By sharing this project with the community, I hope to inspire others to explore the world of game development and foster a love for coding.


## Basic Mode

In the Basic mode, the game randomly selects an integer between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess the number. Here are the basic rules:

- If your guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, you'll receive a message saying "OUT OF BOUNDS."
- On your first turn, if your guess is within 10 of the number, you'll get a "WARM!" message.
- If your guess is further than 10 away from the number, you'll receive a "COLD!" message.
- On subsequent turns:
  - If your guess is closer to the number than your previous guess, you'll be notified with "WARMER!"
  - If your guess is farther from the number than your previous guess, you'll see "COLDER!"

## Advanced Mode

The Advanced mode builds upon the Basic mode by adding a few more features:

- If your guess is within 2 of the number, you'll receive an even more enthusiastic "VERY WARM!" message.
- When you correctly guess the number, the program will not only confirm your success but also tell you how many guesses it took.
